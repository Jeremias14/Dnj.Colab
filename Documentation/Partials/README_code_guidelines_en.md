## Creating project

*   Create the project in the solutions folder according to the type of project you are deploying.
*   If you think a section for the code you implement does not exists already you can create the new folder
   following a coherent structure.

*   Copy and fill the `README-To_Fill_.md` located in Documentation folder. Rename it to `README.md` and put it in the root of your project.
