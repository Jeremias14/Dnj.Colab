## Creating project

*   Create the project in the solutions folder according to the type of project you are deploying.
*   If you think a section for the code you implement does not exists already you can create the new folder
*   following a coherent structure.

### For Samples Section:
*   Copy and fill the `README-Sample.md` located in Documentation folder. Rename it to `README.md` and put it in the root of your project.

### For Training Section:
*   Copy and fill the `README-Training.md` located in Documentation folder. Rename it to `README.md` and put it in the root of your project.
