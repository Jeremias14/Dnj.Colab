Introduction
============

This repository aims to be a meeting point for programmers of all levels. 
The idea is not only to learn to program but also to learn code integration, to know and adopt a professional way of working. 
Appropriate to the way you work in a company. It is an open source repository and anyone is invited to contribute.

There is no restriction of languages or frameworks.
You can contribute code of any other language or framework that is not currently
categorized in the repository ahead.
In that case it would be interesting if you yourself were responsible for the code review to
those categories. Get in touch to manage the permits (https://discord.gg/rPF39zRWQp)

For example: MVVM pattern implementation in Blazor application, Markov chain algorithm implementation in C#...

* **Training**:

The intention is to add here problem solving or exercises of different levels. 
This space can also be used for people who are in the process of learning and who find this site as a point of reference, 
either to resolve doubts or to obtain information from other users about the code that it implements.
